Project Overview
In this project, I implemented hash tables using Linear Probing, Quadratic Probing, and Double Hashing. Additionally, I created a spell checker that utilizes these hash tables to verify and suggest corrections for words from a document against a dictionary.

Current Status
The project is currently not working as expected. There are issues with the hash table implementations and the spell checker logic that I have been unable to resolve.

Problems Faced
Template Instantiation Errors: Difficulties with debugging and fixing template instantiation errors.
Collision Handling: Challenges in implementing and verifying different collision handling strategies.
File I/O Operations: Complications in managing large files for dictionary and document inputs.
Integration Issues: Problems ensuring correct storage and retrieval of words in the hash tables.
Algorithm Efficiency: Struggles with tuning and testing to achieve minimal collisions and efficient performance.

Conclusion
Despite the efforts, the program is currently not functioning correctly. The project has been a valuable learning experience, teaching me about hash tables, collision handling, and spell checking algorithms. I will continue to work on resolving the issues and achieving a fully functional implementation.
